#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

My wife have opted to choose the humanoids development stages as my release milestones. I am not sure how far will this go, but it made more sense then to name animals... Actually, each of them have some deterministic features so I will use them accordingly in future releases(hopefully)

= Milestones =

  # !PreNatal
  # !NewBorn
  # !Infant
  # !Toddler
  # !Pubert
  # !Young Adult (This is the point after which I will start the whole numbers :))
